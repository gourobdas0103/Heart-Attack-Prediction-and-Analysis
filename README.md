## Introduction

Cardiovascular diseases, including heart attacks, are a leading cause of mortality globally. Early prediction and accurate analysis can play a crucial role in improving patient outcomes. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of a heart attack and provides meaningful insights from the data.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Feature selection and engineering
- Machine learning model development
- Prediction of heart attack risk
- Data visualization for analysis

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/preetimahto17/heart-attack-prediction-and-analysis.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd heart-attack-prediction-and-analysis`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset in CSV format and place it in the `data` directory.
2. Run the data preprocessing script: `python preprocess_data.py`
3. Train the prediction model: `python train_model.py`
4. Use the trained model for predictions: `python predict.py`

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle. It contains various attributes such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc. that are relevant to heart health.

## Model

I used multiple machine-learning techniques such as Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree and Random Forest to predict the risk of a heart attack. The model is trained on a labeled dataset and evaluated using relevant metrics.

## Results

Compared the results obtained from all five techniques and SVM performed the best among the five.
